Latte Compiler MRJP 2020Z

Compilation:
  Project is build exclusively by running 'make'. The project is compiled using
  gcc, but will work with any compliant C99 (or higher) compiler (I've tested
  with like 4 of them). All BNFC/Bison/Flex files are already generated, but
  user can regenerate them using 'make grammar' and they should work just fine.

Libraries:
  TODO: Libraries. Except that, the only thing the project relies on is a C99
  standard library.

Catalogues:
  Source code (bnfc files included) is in 'src' directory, object files are
  compiled into 'obj'.
